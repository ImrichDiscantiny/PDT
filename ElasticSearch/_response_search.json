This is an addition to #10478 and fixes a bug where a normal org user could not read settings, breaking the daily data page.\r\n\r\nTest Steps:\r\n* Run the smoke test\r\n\r\nManual Test:\r\n1. Log in to ReportStream as a normal user (Create a new account in Okta if needed)\r\n2. Verify Daily Data page loads\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Updated `SettingsFunctions` `getOne` to support getting an organization better (no longer need to pass in null for orgName, this logic was moved lower down into SettingsFacade)\r\n- Updated getOne and other settings and api key functions to allow for user access (all the ones that are read)\r\n\r\n## Linked Issues\r\n- #1946\r\n\r\n## Future Work\r\n1. #10810\r\n",

Inbound ORM message delivery via etor-service-receiver\r\n2. Outbound OML message delivery via simulated-lab\r\n3. ...without a delivery loop (which we ran into previously when filters were too permissive; e.g. set to '- true')\r\n\r\n## Test Steps:\r\n\r\nPlease refer to the steps in [TI's readme](https://github.com/CDCgov/trusted-intermediary#setup-with-reportstream) to set up for testing\r\n\r\nAfter deployment to staging, we can test by:\r\n1. Submitting a sample [ORM message](https://github.com/CDCgov/trusted-intermediary/blob/f95131801e771290434a7ab0ae135d3836907361/examples/hl7/MN/MN%20NBS%20ORM_O01%20Lab%20Order%20Message.txt) to the Water's endpoint (with client:flexion.simulated-hospital).\r\n2. Viewing the resulting OML in the ReportStream web interface (flexion organization => Daily Data\").\r\n3. If the OML file exists at all, then this change was successful.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Jurisdictional filters now rely on the FHIR path instead of %hl7MessageType\r\n- Quality filters are now simply set to 'true', instead of duplicating the jurisdictional filters\r\n- Commented examples removed\r\n- ...except for TI endpoints for running locally, which have been updated\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- [x] Tested locally?\r\n- [x] Ran `./prime test` or `./gradlew testSmoke` against local Docker ReportStream container? **local smoke test successful!**\r\n- [x] (For Changes to /frontend-react/...)

I feel a well maintained project should not have typos. So, I have fixed them. \r\n\r\nAlso to void future typos, I have added a config setup in pre-commit hook using the [cspell](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cspell) package. This will prevent users from committing code with unintentional mis spellings. \r\n\r\nCreated a [file](https://github.com/kavinkuma6/cal.com/blob/add-cspell-pre-commit-to-fix-typos/.cspell/projectWords.txt), which contains the project specific words or words not found dictionary. This can be used by the package. In future, incase if the user wants to add a non dictionary word to the code,  the same should be added here. I have added a terminal instruction for the same [here](https://github.com/kavinkuma6/cal.com/blob/add-cspell-pre-commit-to-fix-typos/.cspell/cspell.sh#L7) which would be shown in pre commit hook.\r\n\r\nIncase, if we want to check the spelling for the whole project, unlike only the staged files as mentioned above, we can use the newly added script `npm run spell-check`\r\n\r\n<!-- Please provide a loom video for visual changes to speed up reviews\r\n Loom Video: https://www.loom.com/\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Requirement/Documentation\r\n\r\n<!-- Please provide all documents that are important to understand the reason of that PR. -->\r\n\r\n- If there is a requirement document, please, share it here.\r\n- If there is ab UI/UX design document, please, share it here.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n<!-- Please delete bullets that are not relevant. -->\r\n\r\n- [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] Chore (refactoring code, technical debt, workflow improvements)\r\n\r\n## How should this be tested?\r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe the tests that you ran to verify your changes. Provide instructions so we can reproduce. Please also list any relevant details for your test configuration. Write details that help to start the tests -->\r\n\r\n- Are there environment variables that should be set? - No\r\n- What are the minimal test data to have? - NA\r\n- What is expected (happy path) to have (input and output)? - NA\r\n- Any other important info that could help to test that PR: I agree we have lot of variable name changes. But we can do most of the testing in the PR review process itself. Then we can use the other test setups to verify the overall workings. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Mandatory Tasks\r\n\r\n- [ ] Make sure you have self-reviewed the code. A decent size PR without self-review might be rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Right now, we expand a group when writing a trailing end-of-line comment, so e.g., given:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    a: a  # a\r\n    for c in e  # for # c \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe format this expression as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{\r\n    a: a  # a\r\n    for c in e  # for # c\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBlack, meanwhile, doesn't let trailing end-of-line comments expand, so formats as:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n{a: a for c in e}  # a  # for # c\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking through the snapshot diff, this seems to strictly improve Black compatibility (and our current behavior seems like a significant deviation). Even the changes in our own fixtures now better resemble Black as verified in the playground.\r\n\r\nI don't know that I have a super strong opinion on whether to use Black's behavior or our own, but I lead towards following Black's behavior by default.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\nWeird mix on the similarity scores -- some went down a little, some went up a little.\r\n\r\nBefore:\r\n\r\n- `zulip`: 0.99702\r\n- `django`: 0.99784\r\n- `warehouse`: 0.99585\r\n- `build`: 0.75623\r\n- `transformers`: 0.99469\r\n- `cpython`: 0.75988\r\n- `typeshed`: 0.74853\r\n\r\nAfter:\r\n\r\n- `zulip`: 0.99696\r\n- `django`: 0.99785\r\n- `warehouse`: 0.99569\r\n- `build`: 0.75623\r\n- `transformers`: 0.99481\r\n- `cpython`: 0.75987\r\n- `typeshed`: 0.74842\r\n",

On (1), the implementation is very contained, so IMO we can easily swap this out for a more performant solution in the future if needed. On (2), this improves correctness and fixes some bad syntax errors detected by fuzzing, which means it has value even if it's not as robust as an _actual_ `ParenthesizedExpression` node in the AST itself.\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/issues/4925.\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\n\r\n`cargo test` with new cases that previously failed the fuzzer.\r\n",

The `vault` blocks are differentiated by a new `name` field, and if the `name` is omitted it becomes the \"default\" Vault configuration. All blocks with the same name are merged together, as with the existing behavior.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we're still using HCL1 for parsing configuration and the `Decode` method doesn't parse multiple blocks differentiated only by a field name without a label. So we've had to add an extra parsing pass, similar to what we've done for HCL1 jobspecs.\r\n\r\nFor now, all existing consumers will use the \"default\" Vault configuration, so there's no user-facing behavior change in this changeset other than the contents of the agent self API.\r\n\r\nRef: https://github.com/hashicorp/team-nomad/issues/404",

But the team agrees that this is a particularly bad bug to have around so we'll release a 1.3.16 just with this bug fix.\r\n\r\nIf all goes well it will be available by end of day today."

                    "body": "## Hey, I just made a Pull Request!\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty big refactor of the auth backend which moves a lot of existing exports to the `auth-node` package, as well as introduces many new APIs to help build auth provider integrations and modules. The idea is to gradually migrate existing providers to be implemented using these new APIs, while still providing support for the existing auth providers through adapters. Currently only the Google and GCP IAP providers have been migrated.\r\n\r\nThe primary reason for this refactor is to move out the sign-in logic away from the auth integration itself. That in turn allows for more generic sign-in resolver utilities, and also makes it easier to re-implement a custom auth provider module. For example, a Google provider module with a custom sign-in resolver can be implemented like this:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nexport const authModuleGoogleProvider = createBackendModule({\r\n  pluginId: 'auth',\r\n  moduleId: 'googleProvider',\r\n  register(reg) {\r\n    reg.registerInit({\r\n      deps: { providers: authProvidersExtensionPoint },\r\n      async init({ providers }) {\r\n        providers.registerProvider({\r\n          providerId: 'google',\r\n          factory: createOAuthProviderFactory({\r\n            authenticator: googleAuthenticator,\r\n            async signInResolver(info, ctx) {\r\n              // custom resolver ...\r\n            }\r\n          }),\r\n        });\r\n      },\r\n    });\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlong with this new pattern this PR also introduces sign-in resolver factories. They're like the existing functions to create sign-in resolvers, but with the ability to define options that can be passed both through config and code. Configuring sign-in resolvers through config looks like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nauth:\r\n  providers:\r\n    google:\r\n      development:\r\n        clientId: ...\r\n        clientSecret: ...\r\n        signIn:\r\n          resolvers:\r\n            - resolver: emailMatchingUserEntityAnnotation\r\n            - resolver: emailLocalPartMatchingUserEntityName\r\n              enableSomeAdditionalOption: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this PR doesn't introduce any new sign-in resolvers, the idea is that we'll add more capable ones in the future that help cover most use-cases through configuration alone. The custom module pattern shown above then becomes something that you only need to do very rarely for deeper customizations.\r\n\r\nI plan to add some docs for this new API, but probably as a separate guide that we don't promote too much yet. Once we start promoting use of the new backend system we'll switch over the auth docs to this new API instead.\r\n\r\n#### :heavy_check_mark: Checklist\r\n\r\n<!--- Please include the following in your Pull Request when applicable: -->\r\n\r\n- [x] A changeset describing the change and affected packages.

                    "body": "A recent bump of a nested dependency caused our Backstage instance to fail in Safari. This could happen to a future deployment of the opensource Backstage app. \r\n\r\n## Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nSafari should be supported by Backstage but this bug prevents it from being used. \r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\n\r\nIt appears that if `normalize-url` gets bumped to 6.0.1, an \"irregular regex\" error happens, preventing any of the UI from displaying in Safari. This version gets pulled in when `parse-url` gets bumped from 5.0.2 to 5.0.3. `parse-url` is used by `git-up` which is used by `git-url-parse` which is used by several OS components including `@backstage/plugin-catalog` and `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder`.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\n\r\nWe are using a yarn resolution to pin parse-url to 5.0.2 but that doesn't seem like a good long-term strategy.

If you do `yarn why git-url-parse` you should be able to see some duplicates and it's possible that some of those are breaking. If this isn't the case, then it's possible that this is another bug that we should open another ticket for as something else it causing that same error to be thrown but it's a different cause."
